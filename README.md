A minimal LC-3 and x86 based virtual machine.

## Overview
r86 aims to be a simplistic, navigable, and educational virtual machine that offers a casual experience of running machine code instructions to emulate a processor. r86 plans to come with a program loader, debugging tools, and assembler.

## How To Load Machine Code Program
If you would like to run a program using machine code:
* Create a file ending in .txt
* Each line should be a single 32 bit instruction or immediate
* Immediates should go on a new line
* Individual bits can be seperated by whitespace (loader will ignore this)
* Lines can end with comments denoted by //, anything after is ignored by loaders
