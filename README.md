## Overview
Currently under development.

## How To Load Machine Code Program
If you would like to run a program using machine code:
* Create a file ending in .txt
* Each line should be a single 32 bit instruction or immediate
* Immediates should go on a new line
* Individual bits can be seperated by whitespace (loader will ignore this)
* Lines can end with comments denoted by //, anything after is ignored by loaders
