Steps to take:
- Define toy assembly language (opcodes, syntax, registers, etc.)
- Create specification (have formal definition of all instructions and memory sizes)
- Build emulator (has memory space/registers, fetch decode execute)
- Define memory hierarchy
- Build assembler (convert our toyasm into binary format that emulator handles)

Additional (maybe do?):
- Create simple debugging tool
- Look to extend toy ISA and add additional features
