tools we want to build and their purpose:

* toy language compiler (this will take our toy code and translate it into our toy assembly)

* toy assembler (this will take our toy assembly and translate it into a toy ISA)

* toy virtual machine (this will take our toy ISA and actually run this code)

* create shell commands for all this so it is easy and fluent to do each step (or multiple steps at once)
