# Simple Assembler
Responsible for translating assembly into our ISA instructions
## Tasks
Below are some goals for this simple assembler
* Translate mnemonics into machine code instructions
* Resolve symbolic references such as names and labels
* Produce a set of instructions to execute
Due to the simplicity of this ISA, a linker seems unnecessary, so the assembler will immedietely generate an executable, no object files
